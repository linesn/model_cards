## Introduction
We're introducing Ling-3.0-flash, our next-generation native hybrid reasoning model. Operating with **124B** total and **5.1B** active parameters (~12.4% and ~8.1% of our previous 1T-class flagship Ring-2.6-1T), Ling-3.0-flash matches or outperforms its predecessor across key benchmarks.

Key highlights of the model are summarized below:

+ **Native Hybrid-Linear Architecture:** Ling-3.0 adopts a native hybrid linear attention architecture from the very start of pretraining (5:1 alternating stacking of Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) and MLA), upgraded with KDA fine-grained diagonal gating and 1/64 sparse MoE. With 124B total parameters and 5.1B activated parameters, it achieves a synergistic leap in long-context efficiency and computational cost.
+ **Remarkable Efficiency & Performance:** Engineered for speed, compute efficiency, and production deployment, Ling-3.0-flash delivers class-defying performance against both larger SOTA competitors and previous-generation flagships. Activating only 5.1B parameters per token, it provides impressive reasoning, instruction following, and long-context capabilities to empower complex agentic workflows in production environments.
+ **Comprehensive Agentic Evolution:** Tailored for real-world productivity workflows, the model incorporates 10,000+ interactive training environments to achieve end-to-end closed-loop execution across Coding, General, and Deep Research Agent tasks. It natively integrates the SGLang HiCache + Mooncake hierarchical caching architecture (featuring physical dual-pools and a cluster-shared L3 cache), eliminating redundant recomputation during long-horizon interactions and reducing Time to First Token (TTFT) by 60% to over 80% in long-input scenarios.

>     - BrowseComp (Single-Agent): Evaluated using a resume strategy for context management: once the context reaches a 64K-token threshold, the trajectory is summarized, the original history is discarded, and execution is resumed from the summary.
>     - BrowseComp (Multi-Agent): Evaluated using an internal multi-agent search harness based on SearchSwarm/Tongyi DeepResearch, configured with `temperature=0.85, top_p=0.95, max_tokens=8K`, and main/sub-agent context windows of 128K and 64K, respectively.

## Quickstart
### SGLang

The hardware- and recipe-specific launch matrix (BF16/FP8 × Low-Latency / High-Throughput / HiCache + Mooncake), with a live command generator and verified configurations, lives in the SGLang cookbook:

**Cookbook:** https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/InclusionAI/Ling-3.0-flash

#### Install SGLang

Use the pre-built image that tracks the Ling-3.0 runtime:

```bash
docker pull lmsysorg/sglang:dev-Ling-3.0-flash
```

#### Run Inference

Recommended low-latency recipe (built-in MTP / NEXTN, 256K YaRN context) on 4× 141GB-class GPUs (H20-3e) or 4-GPU Blackwell nodes:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size 32g \
  -p 30000:30000 \
  -e HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token> \
  lmsysorg/sglang:dev-Ling-3.0-flash \
  env SGLANG_ALLOW_OVERWRITE_LONGER_CONTEXT_LEN=1 \
  python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path inclusionAI/Ling-3.0-flash \
    --tp 4 \
    --context-length 262144 \
    --speculative-algorithm NEXTN \
    --mem-fraction-static 0.8 \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 30000
```

On 80GB cards (H100 / H800) use `--tp 8` with the same flags; see the cookbook cell for your hardware.

**Client**

Thinking is enabled by default by both the chat template and the `ling3` reasoning parser. Disable it per request with `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}`. We recommend the sampling parameters `temperature=0.6`, `top_p=0.95`, and `top_k=20`.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "inclusionAI/Ling-3.0-flash",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello!"}],
       "stream": true,
       "temperature": 0.6,
       "top_k": 20,
       "top_p": 0.95
     }'
```

For `--reasoning-parser ling3` / `--tool-call-parser ling3`, the HiCache + Mooncake L3 setup, and GSM8K / `bench_serving` reproduction commands, see the cookbook page linked above.

### vLLM
#### Install our vLLM
```bash
pip install uv

uv venv ~/my_ling_env

source ~/my_ling_env/bin/activate

git clone -b ling_3_0 https://github.com/inclusionAI/vllm-ling-v3.git

cd vllm-ling-v3

VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install --editable . --torch-backend=auto
```

#### Run Inference
Here is the example to run Ling-3.0-flash with 4 GPUs, where the server port is `${PORT}`:

**Server**

Since the model is trained with MTP, we recommend enabling MTP during inference (i.e., --speculative-config) for lower latency.

```bash
vllm serve "$MODEL_PATH" \
    --port "$PORT" \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --served-model-name auto \
    --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \
    --enable-prefix-caching \
    --mamba-cache-mode align \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --tool-call-parser ling3 \
    --reasoning-parser ling3 \
    --speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":3}'
```

**Client**

We recommend using the sampling parameters `temperature=0.6`, `top_p=0.95`, and `top_k=20`, and enabling `enable_thinking` for better performance.

```bash
curl -s http://${MASTER_IP}:${PORT}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "auto",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello!"}],
       "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": true},
       "stream": true,
       "temperature": 0.6, 
       "top_k": 20,
       "top_p": 0.95
     }'
```
