# Laguna XS.2
Laguna XS.2 is a 33B total parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 3B activated parameters per token designed for agentic coding and long-horizon work on a local machine. It uses Sliding Window Attention with per-head gating in 30 out of 40 layers for fast inference and low KV cache requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on how we trained this model, including on data automixing and async off-policy agent RL, check out our [release blog post](https://poolside.ai/blog/laguna-a-deeper-dive) and [technical report](https://poolside.ai/assets/laguna/laguna-m1-xs2-technical-report.pdf).

## Highlights
- **Mixed SWA and global attention layout**: Laguna XS.2 uses sigmoid gating with per-layer rotary scales, enabling mixed SWA (Sliding Window Attention) and global attention layers in a 3:1 ratio (across 40 total layers)
- **KV cache in FP8**: KV cache quantized to FP8, reducing memory per token
- **Native reasoning support**: Interleaved thinking between tool calls with support for enabling and disabling thinking per-request
- **Local-ready**: At 33B total parameters and 3B activated, Laguna XS.2 is compact enough to run on a Mac with 36 GB of RAM. [Available on Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/laguna-xs.2)
- **Apache 2.0 license**: Use and modify freely for commercial and non-commercial purposes

*We used the highest publicly-referenced scores for all comparison models across each benchmark. In almost all cases these were official scores published in release blog posts or equivalent, with the exception of Gemma 4 31B IT where the highest published scores were [reported by the Qwen team](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.6-35b-a3b) and Claude Haiku 4.5 where the highest published (verified) scores for SWE-bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 are from their respective official leaderboards.*

<details>
<summary>Expand for benchmarking methodology</summary>

All benchmarking for Laguna XS.2 was completed using the Laude Institute’s Harbor Framework with our [agent harness](https://github.com/poolsideai/pool), using a maximum of 500 steps and sandboxed execution using 8 GB RAM/2 CPUs (with the exception of Terminal-Bench 2.0; see below). The same sampling parameters were used for all benchmarking: temperature=0.7 and top_k=20.  Some base task images and verifiers were patched to fix infrastructure reliability issues inherent in task setup, such as rate limits on third-party dependencies in external registries used by the verifier. More details outlining these updates and other findings will follow in a future technical blog post.

- SWE-bench Verified: mean pass@1 averaged over 4 runs.
- SWE-bench Multilingual: mean pass@1 averaged over 7 runs.
- SWE-bench Pro: mean pass@1 averaged over 3 runs.
- Terminal-Bench 2.0: mean pass@1 averaged over 5 runs. 48GB RAM/32 CPUs.

#### vLLM

Serve Laguna XS.2 locally with vLLM and query it from any OpenAI-compatible client (see [Controlling reasoning](#controlling-reasoning) for tool calls, streaming, and reasoning extraction):

> [!NOTE]
> Laguna XS.2 support is available in vLLM 0.21.0 and later ([vllm-project/vllm#41129](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41129)).

```shell
pip install 'vllm>=0.21.0'

vllm serve \
    --model poolside/Laguna-XS.2 \
    --tool-call-parser poolside_v1 \
    --reasoning-parser poolside_v1 \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --served-model-name laguna \
    --default-chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking": true}'
```

See the [vLLM recipes page](https://recipes.vllm.ai/poolside/Laguna-XS.2) for additional deployment guidance.

#### SGLang

Laguna XS.2 is supported in SGLang via [sgl-project/sglang#24204](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24204). See the [SGLang cookbook entry](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24730) for a serving recipe.

#### Speculative decoding (DFlash)

For lower latency, serve Laguna XS.2 with the [Laguna-XS.2 DFlash speculator](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS.2-speculator.dflash) — a 5-layer Llama-style draft model that proposes up to 7 tokens per step at ~70% per-position acceptance on coding tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> DFlash support landed in vLLM via [vllm-project/vllm#41880](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41880) and is available in vLLM 0.21.0 and later.

```shell
VLLM_USE_DEEP_GEMM=0 vllm serve poolside/Laguna-XS.2 \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --tool-call-parser poolside_v1 \
    --reasoning-parser poolside_v1 \
    --speculative-config '{"model":"poolside/Laguna-XS.2-speculator.dflash","num_speculative_tokens":7,"method":"dflash"}'
```

See the [DFlash section of the vLLM recipes page](https://recipes.vllm.ai/poolside/Laguna-XS.2) for the full recipe.

#### Transformers

Laguna XS.2 is supported in Transformers `v5.7.0` and later ([huggingface/transformers#45673](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/45673)).

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "poolside/Laguna-XS.2"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python retry wrapper with exponential backoff."},
]

# Reasoning is on by default; pass enable_thinking=False to skip the <think> block.
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
    enable_thinking=True,
).to(model.device)

outputs = model.generate(
    inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=20,
)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][inputs.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

#### TRT-LLM

> [!NOTE]
> Requires building TensorRT-LLM from the upstream PR that adds Laguna XS.2 support
> ([NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM#13559](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/13559)).
> Once that PR merges, the same code will work on a released `tensorrt-llm` wheel.

Laguna XS.2's `configuration_laguna.py` imports a few `transformers >= 4.58` symbols.
TRT-LLM currently pins `transformers 4.57`, so the PR ships a `laguna_minimal_overlay.sh` script that symlinks the checkpoint and patches only the config file with a compat shim. Load TRT-LLM against the **overlay directory**, not the original checkpoint.

```shell
# 1. Check out the PR branch and build TRT-LLM from source (see the TensorRT-LLM build docs).
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM.git && cd TensorRT-LLM
git fetch origin pull/13559/head:laguna && git checkout laguna

# 2. Download the checkpoint.
huggingface-cli download poolside/Laguna-XS.2 --local-dir ~/models/Laguna-XS.2

# 3. Build the transformers-4.57 compat overlay (echoes the overlay path).
OVERLAY=$(bash laguna_minimal_overlay.sh ~/models/Laguna-XS.2)
```

```python
from tensorrt_llm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(
    model=OVERLAY,             # overlay path, not the original checkpoint
    trust_remote_code=True,
    tensor_parallel_size=1,
)

sampling = SamplingParams(max_tokens=1024, temperature=0.7, top_k=20)
out = llm.generate(["Write a Python retry wrapper with exponential backoff."], sampling)
print(out[0].outputs[0].text)
```

Or serve with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```shell
trtllm-serve "$OVERLAY" --port 8000 --trust-remote-code
```

The same recipe works for the [FP8](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS.2-FP8) and [NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS.2-NVFP4) variants: quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`, no extra flags required.

## Controlling reasoning

Laguna XS.2 has native reasoning support and is designed to work best with *preserved thinking*, where `reasoning` content from prior assistant messages is preserved in the message history. This model will generally reason before calling tools and between tool calls.

<details>
<summary>Expand for example</summary>

```python
import json
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://inference.poolside.ai/v1",
  api_key="...",
)

model = "poolside/laguna-xs.2"

tools = [{"type": "function", "function": {
  "name": "shell",
  "description": "Execute a bash command and return the output.",
  "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"cmd": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["cmd"]},
}}]

messages = [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding agent with access to a shell tool."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Run uname -a"},
]

# Thinking is enabled by default when the server sets --default-chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking": True}
# When using the Poolside API (https://inference.poolside.ai/v1), this flag is set by default
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=model,
  messages=messages,
  tools=tools,
  stream=True,
)

reasoning, content, tool_calls = "", "", []
for chunk in response:
  delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
  if hasattr(delta, "reasoning_content") and delta.reasoning_content:
    reasoning += delta.reasoning_content
  if hasattr(delta, "content") and delta.content:
    content += delta.content
  if hasattr(delta, "tool_calls") and delta.tool_calls:
    for tc in delta.tool_calls:
      if tc.index >= len(tool_calls):
        tool_calls.append({"id": tc.id, "function": {"name": "", "arguments": ""}})
      if tc.function.name:
        tool_calls[tc.index]["function"]["name"] = tc.function.name
      if tc.function.arguments:
        tool_calls[tc.index]["function"]["arguments"] += tc.function.arguments

print(f"Reasoning: {reasoning}\nContent: {content}\nTool calls: {tool_calls}\n")

# Return reasoning in the next request for best performance
messages.append({
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": content,
  "reasoning_content": reasoning,
  "tool_calls": [{"id": tc["id"], "type": "function", "function": tc["function"]} for tc in tool_calls]
})

messages.append({
  "role": "tool",
  "tool_call_id": tool_calls[0]["id"],
  "content": json.dumps({"stdout": "Darwin arm64", "exit_code": "0"})
})

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=model,
  messages=messages,
  tools=tools,
  stream=True,
)

reasoning, content = "", ""
for chunk in response:
  delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
  if hasattr(delta, "reasoning_content") and delta.reasoning_content:
    reasoning += delta.reasoning_content
  if hasattr(delta, "content") and delta.content:
    content += delta.content

print(f"Reasoning: {reasoning}\nContent: {content}")
```

</details>

### Disabling reasoning

You can disable thinking by setting `enable_thinking` to `False` in a request or by not providing `--default-chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking": True}` or equivalent when starting the server.

<details>
<summary>Expand for example</summary>

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="poolside/laguna-xs.2",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a retry wrapper with exponential backoff."}
  ],
  extra_body={
    "chat_template_kwargs": { "enable_thinking": False },
  },
  stream=True
)

for chunk in completion:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta)
```

</details>

For agentic coding use cases, we recommend enabling thinking and preserving reasoning in message history as outlined in the [Controlling reasoning] section.
