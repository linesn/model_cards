# Laguna S 2.1-NVFP4
Laguna S 2.1-NVFP4 is a 117.6B total parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 8.5B activated parameters per token designed for agentic coding and long-horizon work on a local machine. It uses Sliding Window Attention with per-head gating in 36 out of 48 layers for fast inference and low KV cache requirements.


## Highlights
- **Mixed SWA and global attention layout**: Laguna S 2.1 uses softplus gating with per-layer rotary scales, enabling mixed SWA (Sliding Window Attention) and global attention layers in a 3:1 ratio (across 48 total layers)
- **KV cache in FP8**: KV cache quantized to FP8, reducing memory per token
- **Native reasoning support**: Interleaved thinking between tool calls with support for enabling and disabling thinking per-request
- **Local-ready**: At 117.6B total parameters and 8.5B activated, the NVFP4 weights are roughly 71 GB. Available on [Ollama](https://ollama.com/laguna-s-2.1) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25165) (BF16 and Q4\_K\_M only)
- **OpenMDW-1.1 license**: Use and modify the model and associated materials freely for commercial and non-commercial purposes ([learn more about OpenMDW](https://openmdw.ai/))

## Usage

### Context length

This checkpoint ships configured for a 262,144-token (256K) context window. This is the configuration we recommend for best output quality.

The weights are native 1M checkpoints: training included a long-context extension stage up to 1,048,576 tokens, and quantization was calibrated at the 1M configuration. If you need more than 256K of context, restore the 1M configuration by editing `config.json`:

```json
"rope_parameters": {
  "full_attention": {
    "factor": 128.0,
    "attention_factor": 1.4852030263919618
  }
},
"max_position_embeddings": 1048576
```

You may experience quality degradation with the 1M configuration. If you use it, we recommend sampling with `temperature <= 0.7` and `top_p <= 0.95`.

### Recommended sampling

For the best balance of quality and reliability we recommend sampling with `temperature 0.7` and `top_p 0.95`.


### Local deployment

Laguna S 2.1-NVFP4 is supported in vLLM, SGLang and Transformers, and TRT-LLM thanks to the support of the team at NVIDIA. Use Laguna-S 2.1 with Ollama (with MLX support) or Llama.cpp (BF16 and Q4\_K\_M only) for the best results on your local machine.

#### vLLM

> Serving requires vLLM 0.25.0 or later. See the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) for the full recipe.

The full vLLM recipe is on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) and on the [vLLM recipes page](https://recipes.vllm.ai/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). Quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config` in this checkpoint, so the same command works with `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4` substituted for the model ID. No extra flags required.

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional: speculative decoding with DFlash.** Pair with the quantization-matched draft model [poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4) by adding `--speculative-config '{"model":"poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4","num_speculative_tokens":15,"method":"dflash"}'` to the serve command.

#### DGX Spark & Mac Studio

Ollama is the quickest way to run Laguna S 2.1 on a single 128 GB box, whether
that is an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10) or an Apple Silicon Mac Studio:

```bash
ollama run laguna-s-2.1
```

It pulls the Q4\_K\_M GGUF (about 75 GB) and runs on the GB10 GPU on the Spark
or on Metal on the Mac, with no build step. We measured about 12.6 tokens/s on
the Spark and 17.6 on Apple Silicon.

- You need about 128 GB of unified memory; the Q4\_K\_M weights are around
  75 GB on their own.
- The first load reads 75 GB off disk and can run past Ollama's 5-minute
  default timeout. If it does, set `OLLAMA_LOAD_TIMEOUT=20m`.
- Reasoning is on by default. Pass `"think": false` in the request to turn it off.
- The higher-fidelity tags need a bigger box: `laguna-s-2.1:q8_0` is about
  128 GB (so a 192 GB Mac Studio) and `laguna-s-2.1:f16` is about 235 GB (256 GB
  or more). On the Spark's 128 GB, stick to Q4\_K\_M. Apple Silicon can also
  run it through MLX.
- Ollama is built on llama.cpp. To build the runtime yourself, poolside's
  [`laguna` branch of llama.cpp](https://github.com/poolsideai/llama.cpp/tree/laguna)
  serves the same GGUFs.

**Maximum performance on the DGX Spark (native NVFP4 + DFlash)**

For the fastest setup on the Spark, serve this checkpoint with vLLM instead. That
gives you the native NVFP4 kernels and DFlash speculative decoding.

*One-time setup:*

```bash
# Python headers: Triton JIT needs them and DGX OS ships without them.
# Without this, the first server start dies in triton/runtime/build.py.
sudo apt install -y python3.12-dev

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv ~/venvs/vllm025 -p 3.12

# vLLM 0.25.1 with CUDA-13 torch (aarch64 wheels are on PyPI)
uv pip install -p ~/venvs/vllm025 vllm==0.25.1 --torch-backend=cu130

# FlashInfer nightly trio: without flashinfer-python the NVFP4 path is not
# native; the jit-cache wheel avoids most first-start JIT compilation.
uv pip install -p ~/venvs/vllm025 \
  "flashinfer-python==0.6.15.dev20260712" \

hf download poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4
hf download poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4   # 73 GB total
```

*Serve:*

```bash
export CUTE_DSL_ARCH=sm_121a          # arch string for FP4 kernel JIT
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH # nvcc for JIT
export MAX_JOBS=4                     # cap JIT fan-out; see warning below
source ~/venvs/vllm025/bin/activate

vllm serve poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4 \
  --speculative-config '{"model":"poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4","num_speculative_tokens":15}' \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-call-parser poolside_v1 \
  --reasoning-parser poolside_v1 \
  --override-generation-config '{"temperature":0.7,"top_p":0.95}' \
  --max-num-seqs 32 \
  --max-model-len 262144 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

- You do not need backend flags: auto-selection picks FlashInferCutlass, which
  runs natively on `sm_121`. Do not set `--linear-backend flashinfer_b12x` on
  0.25.1; the opt-in is broken there and it is slower anyway.
- Keep the `--override-generation-config`. Many clients send no sampling
  parameters, and the raw defaults degrade output on the NVFP4 quantization. The
  model's `generation_config.json` sets `top_k 20` (eval-certified truncation),
  which handles that. Do not add `min_p`: vLLM rejects `min_p` and `logit_bias`
  under speculative decoding, so putting it in the defaults returns a 400 on
  every sampled request.
- `--max-num-seqs 32` is required: DFlash crashes vLLM at the default of 256.
- The first start takes about 15 minutes (weight load from NVMe, JIT, and graph
  capture).

> [!WARNING]
> Never drop `MAX_JOBS=4` on a cold `~/.cache/flashinfer`. An uncapped nvcc
> fan-out can exhaust the 128 GB unified memory and take the whole machine down.
> A warm cache makes it a no-op, but the cache is cold again after any config or
> shape change.

Prefill runs 600-800 tok/s, decode is around 15 tok/s on prose and 22-24 on
code, and DFlash accepts 2.9-3.1 tokens per step. At the 256K setting you get
830-870K KV tokens. Two requests at once roughly double total throughput.
Without speculation, decode sits at 13-14 tok/s on every engine we tried on the
GB10, which is the memory-bandwidth ceiling for this model. Speculation is how
you get past it.

*pool CLI against the box:*

```bash
POOLSIDE_STANDALONE_BASE_URL=http://<spark-ip>:8000/v1 \
POOLSIDE_STANDALONE_MODEL=poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4 \
POOLSIDE_STANDALONE_CONTEXT_LENGTH=262144 \
POOLSIDE_API_KEY=dummy pool
```

Use the box's IPv4 address rather than the `.local` mDNS name: Go's resolver can
pick the link-local IPv6 and fail with "no route to host". On macOS the terminal
app needs Local Network permission, and the system curl is exempt from that
check, so if curl works but pool does not, it is the permission and not the
network.

#### SGLang

Laguna S 2.1 is supported in SGLang via [sgl-project/sglang#24204](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24204). Quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`, so no extra flags are required. See the [SGLang cookbook entry](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/Poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) and the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) for a serving recipe.

#### Transformers

The full Transformers recipe is on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). Substitute `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4` for the model ID; quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`.

#### TRT-LLM

Laguna S 2.1 support ships in TensorRT-LLM `>=1.3.0rc16`; see the install recipe on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). Substitute `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4` for the model ID; quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`, no extra flags required.

```python
from tensorrt_llm import LLM

llm = LLM(model="poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4", trust_remote_code=True)
```

#### Ollama

Available on the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/laguna-s-2.1).
