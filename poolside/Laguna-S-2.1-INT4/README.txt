# Laguna S 2.1-INT4
Laguna S 2.1-INT4 is a 117.6B total parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 8.5B activated parameters per token designed for agentic coding and long-horizon work on a local machine. It uses Sliding Window Attention with per-head gating in 36 out of 48 layers for fast inference and low KV cache requirements.


## Highlights
- **Mixed SWA and global attention layout**: Laguna S 2.1 uses softplus gating with per-layer rotary scales, enabling mixed SWA (Sliding Window Attention) and global attention layers in a 3:1 ratio (across 48 total layers)
- **KV cache in FP8**: KV cache quantized to FP8, reducing memory per token
- **Native reasoning support**: Interleaved thinking between tool calls with support for enabling and disabling thinking per-request
- **Local-ready**: At 117.6B total parameters and 8.5B activated, the INT4 weights are roughly 72 GB. Available on [Ollama](https://ollama.com/laguna-s-2.1) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25165) (BF16 and Q4\_K\_M only)
- **OpenMDW-1.1 license**: Use and modify the model and associated materials freely for commercial and non-commercial purposes ([learn more about OpenMDW](https://openmdw.ai/))

## Usage

### Context length

This checkpoint ships configured for a 262,144-token (256K) context window. This is the configuration we recommend for best output quality.

The weights are native 1M checkpoints: training included a long-context extension stage up to 1,048,576 tokens, and quantization was calibrated at the 1M configuration. If you need more than 256K of context, restore the 1M configuration by editing `config.json`:

```json
"rope_parameters": {
  "full_attention": {
    "factor": 128.0,
    "attention_factor": 1.4852030263919618
  }
},
"max_position_embeddings": 1048576
```

You may experience quality degradation with the 1M configuration. If you use it, we recommend sampling with `temperature <= 0.7` and `top_p <= 0.95`.

### Recommended sampling

For the best balance of quality and reliability we recommend sampling with `temperature 0.7` and `top_p 0.95`.


### Local deployment

Laguna S 2.1-INT4 is supported in vLLM and Transformers. Use Laguna S 2.1 with Ollama (with MLX support) or Llama.cpp (BF16 and Q4\_K\_M only) for the best results on your local machine.

#### vLLM

> Serving requires vLLM 0.25.0 or later. See the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) for the full recipe.

The full vLLM recipe is on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) and on the [vLLM recipes page](https://recipes.vllm.ai/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). Quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config` in this checkpoint, so the same command works with `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-INT4` substituted for the model ID. No extra flags required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> INT4 support landed in vLLM with [vllm-project/vllm#47154](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47154). This checkpoint mixes INT4 and group-quantized INT8 experts, which earlier builds rejected in the Marlin WNA16 MoE path. Use a vLLM build that includes this fix.

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional: speculative decoding with DFlash.** Pair with the quantization-matched draft model [poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-INT4](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-INT4) by adding `--speculative-config '{"model":"poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-INT4","num_speculative_tokens":15,"method":"dflash"}'` to the serve command.

#### SGLang

The full SGLang recipe is on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) and on the [SGLang cookbook](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/Poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). SGLang reads the checkpoint quantization_config, so you can use the same launch command after replacing the model ID

#### Transformers

The full Transformers recipe is on the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1). Substitute `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-INT4` for the model ID; quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`.

#### llama.cpp

Serve the GGUF builds with Poolside's llama.cpp fork, branch [`laguna`](https://github.com/poolsideai/llama.cpp/tree/laguna). See the main [Laguna S 2.1 model card](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1) for the build recipe. llama.cpp serves the BF16, Q8\_0, and Q4\_K\_M GGUF builds, not the INT4 safetensors.

#### Ollama

Available on the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/laguna-s-2.1).


## Controlling reasoning

Laguna S 2.1-INT4 uses the same reasoning controls (interleaved thinking, preserved reasoning, and the `enable_thinking` flag) as the base model. See the [Controlling reasoning](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-S-2.1#controlling-reasoning) section of the main Laguna S 2.1 model card.
