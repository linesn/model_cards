# Laguna XS 2.1
Laguna XS 2.1 is a 33B total parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 3B activated parameters per token designed for agentic coding and long-horizon work on a local machine. This model is an upgraded version of our [Laguna XS.2](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS.2) model with a +5.4% jump on SWE-bench Multilingual as well as stronger performance on terminal-style tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> For more details on how we train, including on data automixing and async off-policy agent RL, check out our recent [technical report](https://poolside.ai/assets/laguna/laguna-m1-xs2-technical-report.pdf).

## Highlights
- **Mixed SWA and global attention layout**: Laguna XS 2.1 uses sigmoid gating with per-layer rotary scales, enabling mixed SWA (Sliding Window Attention) and global attention layers in a 3:1 ratio (across 40 total layers)
- **KV cache in FP8**: KV cache quantized to FP8, reducing memory per token
- **Native reasoning support**: Interleaved thinking between tool calls with support for enabling and disabling thinking per-request
- **Local-ready**: At 33B total parameters and 3B activated, Laguna XS 2.1 is compact enough to run on a Mac with 36 GB of RAM. Available on [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/laguna-xs-2.1) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25165). High-quality FP8, NVFP4 and INT4 quantized variants available ([see the collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/poolside/laguna-xs-21))
- **OpenMDW-1.1 license**: Use and modify the model and associated materials freely for commercial and non-commercial purposes ([learn more about OpenMDW](https://openmdw.ai/))

<details>
<summary>Expand for benchmarking methodology</summary>

All benchmarking for Laguna XS 2.1 was completed using Laude Institute’s Harbor Framework with our [agent harness](https://github.com/poolsideai/pool), with a maximum of 500 steps and sandboxed execution. The same sampling parameters were used for all Laguna XS 2.1 benchmarking: temperature=1.0, top_k=20 and top_p=1, with thinking mode enabled and a context length of 256K tokens. All tasks were run in their own sandbox using 8 GB RAM/2 CPUs, with the exception of Terminal-Bench 2.0, which used 48 GB RAM/32 CPUs.

Some base task images and verifiers were patched to fix infrastructure reliability issues inherent in task setup, such as rate limits on third-party dependencies in external registries used by the verifier. All four agentic benchmarks were run with patched images. We also ran a reward-hack judge post-hoc on Laguna XS 2.1 evaluation runs and did not find significant reward hacking after joint judge review and manual review.

- SWE-bench Verified: mean pass@1 averaged over 4 attempts per task
- SWE-bench Multilingual: mean pass@1 averaged over 4 attempts per task
- SWE-Bench Pro: mean pass@1 averaged over 2 attempts per task
- Terminal-Bench 2.0: mean pass@1 averaged over 5 attempts per task; 48 GB RAM/32 CPUs

#### Feedback and issues

Submit feedback with `/feedback` and read the [full documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/poolsideai/pool).

### Local deployment

Laguna XS 2.1 is supported in vLLM, SGLang, Transformers and Llama.cpp, and TRT-LLM thanks to the support of the team at NVIDIA. Use Laguna-XS 2.1 with Ollama (with MLX support) and the mlx-lm framework for the best experience on your local machine.

#### vLLM

Serve Laguna XS 2.1 locally with vLLM and query it from any OpenAI-compatible client (see [Controlling reasoning](#controlling-reasoning) for tool calls, streaming, and reasoning extraction):

> [!NOTE]
> Laguna XS 2.1 support is available in vLLM 0.21.0 and later ([vllm-project/vllm#41129](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41129)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a vLLM build that includes [vllm-project/vllm#47311](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/47311). Without that fix, the `poolside_v1` tool parser silently drops Laguna XS 2.1 tool calls that have no newline after the function name, and the raw tool-call markup leaks into the response. On an older build, pass `--tool-call-parser glm47` (the GLM 4.7 parser) instead.

```shell
pip install 'vllm>=0.21.0'

vllm serve \
    --model poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1 \
    --tool-call-parser poolside_v1 \
    --reasoning-parser poolside_v1 \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice \
    --served-model-name laguna \
    --default-chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking": true}'
```

See the [vLLM recipes page](https://recipes.vllm.ai/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1) for additional deployment guidance.

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional: speculative decoding with DFlash.** For lower latency, pair Laguna XS 2.1 with the [DFlash speculator](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-DFlash), a 5-layer Llama-style draft model that proposes up to 7 tokens per step at ~70% per-position acceptance on coding tasks. vLLM support is in progress in [vllm-project/vllm#46853](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/46853); once it lands, add `--speculative-config '{"model":"poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-DFlash","num_speculative_tokens":7,"method":"dflash"}'` to the serve command above.

#### SGLang

Laguna XS 2.1 is supported in SGLang via [sgl-project/sglang#24204](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24204). See the [SGLang cookbook entry](https://docs.sglang.io/cookbook/autoregressive/Poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1) for a serving recipe.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git
cd sglang
pip install -e "python[all]"

python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1 \
  --tp-size 8 \
  --mem-fraction-static 0.7 \
  --reasoning-parser poolside_v1 \
  --trust-remote-code
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional: speculative decoding with DFlash.** The [DFlash speculator](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-DFlash) can be paired with Laguna XS 2.1 for lower latency. SGLang support was added in [sgl-project/sglang#29446](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/29446). Add `--speculative-algorithm DFLASH \ --speculative-draft-model-path poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-DFlash-FP8` to the serve command above.

#### Transformers

Laguna XS 2.1 is supported in Transformers `v5.7.0` and later ([huggingface/transformers#45673](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/45673)).

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python retry wrapper with exponential backoff."},
]

# Reasoning is on by default; pass enable_thinking=False to skip the <think> block.
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
    enable_thinking=True,
).to(model.device)

outputs = model.generate(
    inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_k=20,
)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][inputs.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

#### TRT-LLM

Laguna XS 2.1 support is merged into TensorRT-LLM ([NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM#13559](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/13559)) and ships in the `v1.3.0rc16` pre-release wheels and later.

> [!NOTE]
> A stable `v1.3.0` has not been released yet, so install a pre-release wheel from NVIDIA's package index (the latest stable, `v1.2.x`, does not include Laguna XS 2.1 support). To build from source instead, see the TensorRT-LLM build documentation. Laguna XS 2.1 support is on `main`.

Install the **CUDA-13 `torch` build first**, then TensorRT-LLM. The default PyPI `torch` is a CUDA-12 build whose `cuda-bindings` pin conflicts with TRT-LLM's `cuda-python 13.x`, so a bare `pip install tensorrt-llm` fails to resolve; installing the cu130 `torch` up front avoids it.

```shell
# 1. CUDA-13 torch build (pins cuda-bindings 13.x, matching TRT-LLM's cuda-python)
pip install 'torch==2.10.0' torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130

# 2. TRT-LLM from NVIDIA's index (torch already satisfied, so it is not replaced)
pip install --pre 'tensorrt-llm>=1.3.0rc16' \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

This resolves to `tensorrt-llm 1.3.0rc20` with `torch 2.10.0+cu130`, `cuda-python 13.0.3`, and `transformers 5.5.4`.

Load the checkpoint directly with `trust_remote_code=True`. No `transformers` compatibility overlay is required: `v1.3.0rc16+` pins `transformers 5.5.4`, which provides the symbols Laguna XS 2.1's config needs (earlier TRT-LLM releases pinned `transformers 4.57`, which did not).

```python
from tensorrt_llm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(
    model="poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1",
    trust_remote_code=True,
    tensor_parallel_size=1,
)

sampling = SamplingParams(max_tokens=1024, temperature=1.0, top_k=20)
out = llm.generate(["Write a Python retry wrapper with exponential backoff."], sampling)
print(out[0].outputs[0].text)
```

Or serve with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```shell
trtllm-serve poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1 --port 8000 --trust-remote-code --tool_parser poolside_v1 --reasoning_parser laguna
```

The Laguna XS 2.1 tool-call and reasoning parsers are built into TRT-LLM `>=1.3.0rc16` (shipped with [#13559](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/13559)), so no extra install is needed. Note that the flag names differ from vLLM's (`--tool_parser`, and the reasoning parser is `laguna`, not `poolside_v1`).

The same recipe works for the [FP8](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-FP8) and [NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-NVFP4) variants: quantization is detected automatically from `quantization_config`, no extra flags required.

> [!NOTE]
> **Optional: speculative decoding with DFlash.** The [DFlash speculator](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-DFlash) can be paired with Laguna XS 2.1 for lower latency. TRT-LLM support is in progress in [NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM#15666](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15666).

#### llama.cpp

> [!NOTE]
> Requires building llama.cpp from the upstream PR that adds Laguna XS 2.1 support until it lands ([ggml-org/llama.cpp#25165](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25165)).

Official GGUF conversions (BF16 and Q4\_K\_M) are available at [poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-GGUF).

```shell
# Build llama.cpp from the PR branch
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
git fetch origin pull/25165/head:laguna && git checkout laguna
cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j

# Download a GGUF and serve an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
huggingface-cli download poolside/Laguna-XS-2.1-GGUF Laguna-XS-2.1-Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir ~/models/Laguna-XS-2.1-GGUF
./build/bin/llama-server -m ~/models/Laguna-XS-2.1-GGUF/Laguna-XS-2.1-Q4_K_M.gguf --jinja --port 8000
```

#### Ollama

Available on the [Ollama library](https://ollama.com/library/laguna-xs-2.1).

    ollama run laguna-xs-2.1          # default — Q4_K_M (imatrix)
    ollama run laguna-xs-2.1:q8_0     # higher precision
    ollama run laguna-xs-2.1:bf16     # full precision

Reasoning and tool-calling work out of the box via the built-in `laguna` template.

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS (Metal) users:** `ollama run` may currently return empty output on Apple Silicon (a Metal f16 overflow in the MoE down-projection; fix pending in [ggml-org/llama.cpp#25389](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25389)). Until it ships, use a Linux/CUDA host or the `/api/generate` endpoint with `"raw": true`.

#### Atomic Chat

Laguna XS 2.1 is also available in [Atomic Chat](https://atomic.chat/), a desktop app for running local models with a simple chat UI. To try it, download Atomic Chat, open the app, and choose Laguna XS 2.1 from the recommended models.

## Controlling reasoning

Laguna XS 2.1 has native reasoning support and is designed to work best with *preserved thinking*, where `reasoning` content from prior assistant messages is preserved in the message history. This model will generally reason before calling tools and between tool calls.

Reasoning may not be generated in follow-up steps if prior thinking blocks are dropped (i.e., thinking is not preserved) when messages are reconstructed over multiple steps.

  {"role": "user", "content": "Run uname -a"},
]

# Thinking is enabled by default when the server sets --default-chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking": True}
# When using OpenRouter's Chat API (https://openrouter.ai/api/v1), this flag is set by default
response = client.chat.completions.create(

  if hasattr(delta, "content") and delta.content:
    content += delta.content

print(f"Reasoning: {reasoning}\nContent: {content}")
```

</details>

### Disabling reasoning

You can disable thinking by setting `enable_thinking` to `False` in a request or by not providing `--default-chat-template-kwargs {"enable_thinking": True}` or equivalent when starting the server.

<details>
<summary>Expand for example</summary>

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="poolside/laguna-xs-2.1",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a retry wrapper with exponential backoff."}
  ],
  extra_body={
    "chat_template_kwargs": { "enable_thinking": False },
  },
  stream=True
)

for chunk in completion:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta)
```

</details>

For agentic coding use cases, we recommend enabling thinking and preserving reasoning in message history as outlined in the [Controlling reasoning](#controlling-reasoning) section.
